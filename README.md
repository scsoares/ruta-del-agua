# Ruta del Agua de Telde

Ruta del Agua de Telde (Telde's Water Route) is a hiking route located in Telde, Gran Canaria. My classmates and I, accompanied by CIFP San Crist√≥bal's Tourism students, explored this route in January 2024. As part of a class assignment, I am currently developing a dedicated website delving into its history.
